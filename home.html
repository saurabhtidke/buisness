        <p>
          Information technology (IT) services are the services that allow
          businesses to access the technical tools and information they use for
          their operational processes and daily tasks. Often, teams with
          expertise in IT or computer science manage these services for
          organizations in many industries. Depending on an organization's
          business type, IT services team can either comprise internal teams or
          external IT teams. For instance, in the medical field, an IT team for
          a hospital may provide services that keep hospital databases
          operational and easy to use for staff members. In a small business
          setting, IT services can include online storage accounts for business
          data and network security for transactions over the internet.

              <h3>Software development</h3>
              <p>
                IT services can often include software development processes to
                create custom applications that fulfill specific business needs.
                For example, a startup business may rely on its IT service team
                to create a software application for organizing and maintaining
                venture capitalist records. In these cases, IT can provide the
                services you need to develop personalized software and ensure
                the program's viability through continuous testing, development
                and maintenance.

              <h3>Troubleshooting and technical support</h3>
              <p>
                IT services for many organizations also include technical
                support and troubleshooting for software applications, programs
                and online tools. Teams that offer these services often guide
                users through the process of resolving technical errors or
                recommend further steps to take, such as sending in the device
                for repairs. With a dedicated technical support service, your
                organization can receive the technical assistance it needs when
                staff members have questions or challenges when using company
                software.
